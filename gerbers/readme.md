there are two version: 

the smaller pcb powered directly by the pi via usb. soldered with smd components where possible.

the general purpose pcb with 12v barrel jack connection to use with larger pumps, use of through hole components - this is NOT recommended anymore thus still might be applicable in some use cases. if unsure, use 5V!
