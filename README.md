Thank you for your interest! In this git you find everything you need to build your own bcmeter. For more informations visit www.bcmeter.org

in /gerbers there are two versions of the pcb available. there is a general purpose pcb for use with 12v and one smaller which is powered by the raspberry pi directly.

in /stl you find the files for 3d printing. as of july 2021 there is one case for the general purpose circuit board (PCB) but the smaller PCB fits as well. We will create a smaller case as well to reduce the costs to print, if the big case is not necessary. 

bcMeter.py is the python script which saves the data as csv

/interface contains a simple d3.js interface for reading out the csv file

renderings of the pcb and case
