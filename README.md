Thank you for your interest! In this git you find everything you need to build your own bcmeter. For more informations visit www.bcmeter.org

in /stl you find the files for 3d printing. as of july 2021 there is one case for the bigger pumps and pcb. 
in /gerbers there are two versions of the pcb available. there is a general purpose pcb for use with 12v and one smaller which is powered by the raspberry pi directly.
bcMeter.py is the python script which saves the data as csv
/interface contains a simple d3.js interface for reading out the csv file
